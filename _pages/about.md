Hi, my name is Kaiyue Peng, a second year PhD student in theoretical chemistry at UC Berkeley. My research interests include nanomaterials, quantum dynamics, and light-matter interactions. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Eran Rabani](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/chem/rabani). You can find more information on our group webpage: [Rabani Group at UC Berkeley](https://therabanigroup.wixsite.com/rabani-group). 

Besides my research, I enjoy watching movies, including Science Fiction, Fantasy, Mystery film and Animated Comedy. I am also interested in Chinese Philosophy and history recently, something far from chemistry haha.
