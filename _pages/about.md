Hi, my name is Kaiyue Peng, a forth year PhD student in theoretical chemistry at UC Berkeley. My research interests include nanomaterials, quantum dynamics, and light-matter interactions. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Eran Rabani](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/chem/rabani). You can find more information on our group webpage: [Rabani Group at UC Berkeley](https://therabanigroup.wixsite.com/rabani-group). 

Tip: How to pronounce "Yue"? The vowel is not found in the English language. But you can get a very good approximation by starting with "Yu" and finishing with "eh".
