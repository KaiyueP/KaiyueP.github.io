读书笔记： 《Wisdom of Life》叔本华


Property
-----
For property, there is no absolute or definite amount of wealth to satisfy a person, so it could be very difficult to define the limits that imposed on the desire for wealth. The independent fortune should be regarded to against evils and misfortunes that a person may encoumter, instead of for pleasure or just spend it. (I don't think so, there are so many things people can try that cost money. Life is short, so have fun!) Also, it is difficult to rie if yout poverty is greater than your talent. He also has some comments on how poor or wealthy people treat wealth. A much more complex topic would be, how to beat poverty in the world.
