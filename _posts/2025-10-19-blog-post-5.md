读书笔记： 《Wisdom of Life》叔本华

为什么我想研究它
-----
还是因为读博太无聊啦 （并不是，科学是哲学，哲学也是哲学）。读博是研究人生哲学的过程，也改变了我许多。我希望在研究科学的同时也可以更好的认识自己，认识如何看待世界和自己。

Introduction
========

Schopenhauer divided the fundenmental differences in hunman lot to three distinct classes: personality, property and how a person stands in the estimation of others. (叔本华应该是有性别歧视的) 

Personality
-----
For personality, Schopenhauer put a lot emphasis in health, which contributes to 9/10 of our happiness. Two foes of human happiness are pain and boredom. He says: Needy surroundings and poverty produce pain while if a person is more than well off, turns to be bored. So a suitable amout of money is very impoartant. And inward wealth (wealth of mind) protest against boredom. To be happy means self-sufficient, the happiest destiny is to have rare gift of a rich individuality.
Sourse of possible pleasure may come from vital energy (food, drink, sleep...), muscular energy (sports), and sensibility (feeling, thinking, learning...). 

叔本华认为，当欲望得到满足时，人会获得快乐，但是失去追求又会带来新的无聊与空虚。所以会开始寻找新的目标。身体的痛苦可以用健康来治愈，心灵的空虚则需要富足的内心世界了。
